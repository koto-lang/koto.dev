# Extra Libs

In addition to the core library, extra non-core libraries are currently included 
by default with the Koto CLI. 
These libraries can also be optionally added to applications where needed. 

The long term plan for these libraries is that once a package manager for Koto
is in place, then they'll be unbundled from the CLI, but for now they're 
developed and distributed with the main project.
