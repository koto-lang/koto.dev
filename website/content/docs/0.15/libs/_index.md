# Extra Libs

In addition to the core library, extra non-core libraries are currently included 
by default with the Koto CLI. 
These libraries can also be optionally added to applications where needed. 

The extra libraries are currently developed and distributed with the main Koto
project. The long term plan is that if/when a package manager for Koto is in 
place, then they'll be unbundled into separate projects.
