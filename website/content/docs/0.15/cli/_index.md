# The Koto CLI

Koto was originally designed as an extension language for Rust applications, 
but it is also usable as a standalone scripting language via the Koto [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). 
The CLI can run `.koto` scripts, and provides an interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop). 

## Installation

Installing the Koto CLI currently requires the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) toolchain 
(see [rustup.sh](https://rustup.sh) for installation instructions). 

With Rust available on your system, run `cargo install koto_cli`, 
which provides you with the `koto` command.

## Using the REPL

Running `koto` without any arguments will start the Koto REPL, 
where Koto expressions can be entered and evaluated interactively. 

````
> koto
Welcome to Koto 

» 1 + 1
➝ 2

» 'hello!'
➝ hello!
````

## Help

The [language guide](../language/) and the [core library reference](../core/), 
can be accessed in the REPL using the `help` command. 

````
> koto
Welcome to Koto

» help bool

  Booleans are declared with the `true` and `false` keywords, 
  and combined using the `and` and `or` operators.
