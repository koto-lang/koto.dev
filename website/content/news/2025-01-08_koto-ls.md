With the [release][crates] of `koto-ls`, Koto now has an [LSP][lsp] server, greatly improving Koto's editing experience.

<!-- more -->

`koto-ls` provides several useful IDE features like renaming symbols and jump-to-definition. With the [Rust toolchain][rustup] available on your system, `koto-ls` can be installed easily via `cargo install koto-ls`.

If you use the [Helix][helix] editor, then `koto-ls` will start working automatically when opening a `.koto` file. For help on getting set up with other editors, and more information in general, take a look at the [koto-ls readme][readme].
