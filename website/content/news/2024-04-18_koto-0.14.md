[Koto 0.14][crates] has been released, bringing API improvements and improved 
[library documentation][lib-docs].

### Koto?

Koto is a free and open-source programming language with the goal of being an
ideal scripting language for Rust applications.

If this is the first time you're hearing about it, you can take a look at
['About Koto'][about], or you could dive straight into the 
[language guide][guide].

{% changelog(version="0.14") %}

### Added 

#### API

- `KMap::get` has been introduced as simpler alternative to 
  `KMap::data().get().cloned()`.

#### Libs

- Markdown docs have been added for the extra libs.
- `random.pick` can now be used with objects and maps that implement `@[]`

### Changed

#### API 

- The use of `CallArgs` has been simplified with the introduction of `From`
  implementations for single values, arrays, and slices. 
  - `CallArgs::None` has been removed, instead you can pass in `&[]`.
- The `run_function`/`run_instance_function` methods in `Koto` and `KotoVm` have
  been renamed to `call_function` and `call_instance_function`.

#### Libs

- `regex.find_all` now returns `null` when no matches are found.
- `regex.captures` now doesn't add extra by-index entries for named capture
  groups. `map.get_index` can be used to explicitly retrieve groups by index.

### Removed

#### API

- `Koto::run_exported_function` has been removed. Functions can be accessed via
  `Koto::exports().get()` and then called with `Koto::call_function()`.
- `Koto::run_with_args` has been removed. For equivalent behaviour, 
  `Koto::set_args` can be called before calling `Koto::run`.

### Fixed

#### Language

- Arguments in paren-free function calls no longer require whitespace after
  commas. e.g. `f 1,2,3` would previously be rejected.
